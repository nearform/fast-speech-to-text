# OpenAI Whisper (Full Transcription)

This is more here as a baseline/control than anything else - can we send a full audio file, recording in-browser, to a NodeJS server and get it to respond with a complete transcription? Yes. Is doing this fast? No.

See the [Chunked Audio writeup](./openai-chunked.md) for a better exploration of OpenAI Whisper for this usecase.
